| Variable      | Description                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LIB_SYNTH` | The library used for synthesis by yosys. <br> (Default: `$::env(PDK_ROOT)/$::env(PDK)/libs.ref/$::env(STD_CELL_LIBRARY)/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib`)|
| `SYNTH_BIN` | The yosys binary used in the flow. <br> (Default: `yosys`) |
| `SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL`  | The cell to drive the input ports. <br>(Default: `sky130_fd_sc_hd__inv_8`)|
| `SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL_PIN`  | The name of the SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL output pin. <br>(Default: `Y`)|
| `SYNTH_CAP_LOAD` | The capacitive load on the output ports in femtofarads. <br> (Default: `17.65` ff)|
| `SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT`  | The max load that the output ports can drive. <br> (Default: `5` cells) |
| `SYNTH_MAX_TRAN` | The max transition time (slew) from high to low or low to high on cell inputs in ns. Used in synthesis <br> (Default: Calculated at runtime as `10%` of the provided clock period, unless this exceeds a set DEFAULT_MAX_TRAN, in which case it will be used as is). |
| `SYNTH_STRATEGY` | Strategies for abc logic synthesis and technology mapping <br> Possible values are `DELAY/AREA 0-3/0-2`; the first part refers to the optimization target of the synthesis strategy (area vs. delay) and the second one is an index. <br> (Default: `AREA 0`)|
| `SYNTH_BUFFERING` | Enables abc cell buffering <br> Enabled = 1, Disabled = 0 <br> (Default: `1`)|
| `SYNTH_SIZING` | Enables abc cell sizing (instead of buffering) <br> Enabled = 1, Disabled = 0 <br> (Default: `0`)|
| `SYNTH_READ_BLACKBOX_LIB` | A flag that enable reading the full(untrimmed) liberty file as a blackbox for synthesis. Please note that this is not used in technology mapping. This should only be used when trying to preserve gate instances in the rtl of the design.  <br> Enabled = 1, Disabled = 0 <br> (Default: `0`)|
| `SYNTH_NO_FLAT` | A flag that disables flattening the hierarchy during synthesis, only flattening it after synthesis, mapping and optimizations. <br> Enabled = 1, Disabled = 0 <br> (Default: `0`)|
| `SYNTH_SHARE_RESOURCES` | A flag that enables yosys to reduce the number of cells by determining shareable resources and merging them. <br> Enabled = 1, Disabled = 0 <br> (Default: `1`)|
| `SYNTH_ADDER_TYPE` | Adder type to which the $add and $sub operators are mapped to. <br> Possible values are `YOSYS/FA/RCA/CSA`; where `YOSYS` refers to using Yosys internal adder definition, `FA` refers to full-adder structure, `RCA` refers to ripple carry adder structure, and `CSA` refers to carry select adder. <br> (Default: `YOSYS`)|
