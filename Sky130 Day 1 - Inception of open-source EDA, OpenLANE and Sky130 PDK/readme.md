   *   Every microcontroller board will  have a chip, essential components, and interfaces  with it.
   *  `Package`: a container that holds the semiconductor die
        * for mechanical protection, thermal management, and electrical performance.
        *  DIP (Dual In-line Package), QFP (Quad Flat Package), BGA (Ball Grid Array), and CSP (Chip Scale Package)

   * [The package will be mounted on the die Once positioned, it's connected to the package's leads or pads.](<img width="572" alt="3" src="https://github.com/navi2311/DIGITAL-VLSI-SOC-DESIGN-AND-PLANNING/assets/134842758/159c93fc-5a4c-44c1-9d02-3e7439edbc11">)

   * These connections are crucial because they allow the die to communicate with external devices. The signals and power that the die needs to operate are transferred through these connections.
   * In `Core` all the digital logic will be placed. like the processor and Ips(synthesizable IPS and Non-synthesizable IPS)
