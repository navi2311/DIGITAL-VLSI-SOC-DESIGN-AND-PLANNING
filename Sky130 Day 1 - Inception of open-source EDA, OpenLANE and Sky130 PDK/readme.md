   *   Every microcontroller board will  have a chip, essential components, and interfaces  with it.
   *  `Package`: a container that holds the semiconductor die
        * for mechanical protection, thermal management, and electrical performance.
        *  DIP (Dual In-line Package), QFP (Quad Flat Package), BGA (Ball Grid Array), and CSP (Chip Scale Package)
